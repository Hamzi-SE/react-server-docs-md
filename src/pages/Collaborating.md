## Branching Guide for React Server

This branching guide outlines a strategy that utilizes feature branches, release branches, and fix branches to improve your team's workflow and overall software development process for React Server.

### Branching Overview

There are three main types of branches in this strategy:

1. Feature branches: feature/my-feature
2. Release branches: release/v2.0.1-pre-alpha
3. Fix branches: fix/issue-description

### Branching Workflow

#### Feature Branches

- Create a new branch from the latest release branch.
- Name the branch using the format: feature/my-feature
- Work on your feature, committing changes as needed.
- When the feature is complete, create a pull request to merge it into the release branch.

#### Release Branches

- Create a new release branch from the master branch.
- Name the branch using the format: release/v2.0.1-pre-alpha
- Merge completed feature branches into the release branch in iterations.
- Test and review the release branch thoroughly.
- When the release branch is stable and ready, create a pull request to merge it into the master branch.
- Tag the new release on the master branch with the appropriate SemVer.

#### Fix Branches

- Create a new branch from the latest release or master branch, depending on where the issue is found.
- Name the branch using the format: fix/issue-description
- Work on the fix, committing changes as needed.
- Create a pull request to merge the fix branch into both the release and master branches.

### Important Notes

- Master branch only receives stable SemVer releases merged from release branches.
- Release branches receive completed features and undergo testing and review before merging into the master branch.
- Branch protection is enabled on the master branch to ensure stability.
